## We Are Your Community
We Are Your Community - Erin Youngblood-Smith and Amy Mathieson are two Masters of Social Work (MSW) students at Humboldt State University focusing on sharing the experiences of African American students with the community. Students of color report feeling isolated and unwelcome and experience acts of discrimination in Humboldt County. In light of this and other recent events, we feel the need for student's stories to be heard is now greater than ever. For our project, four African American students were interviewed about their positive and negative experiences in Humboldt County. These [video interviews](https://www.facebook.com/pg/weareyourcommunity/videos/?ref=page_internal) will be used to create a powerful diversity campaign titled “We Are Your Community.”
